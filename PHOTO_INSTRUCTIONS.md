# How to Add Your Photos to the Love Journey Website

## Quick Instructions

You have 5 beautiful photos to add. Here's how to save them to the project:

### Step 1: Save Your Photos

Save each photo from your phone/computer to the **Bhaviiiii** folder with these exact names:

1. **photo1.jpg** - The wooden cabin photo (you two adoring each other)
2. **photo2.jpg** - The outdoor photo with trees  
3. **photo3.jpg** - The casual selfie photo
4. **photo4.jpg** - The mirror selfie photo
5. **photo5.jpg** - The elegant formal photo (in wedding/celebration attire)

### Step 2: That's It!

Once you save the photos with those exact names in the same folder as `index.html`, they will automatically appear in the website!

## Photo Mapping

Here's which photo goes where in your Love Journey:

- **Chapter 1: Our First Meeting ✨** → photo1.jpg (wooden cabin)
- **Chapter 2: Adventures Together 🌍** → photo2.jpg (outdoor with trees)
- **Chapter 3: Your Creativity Inspires Me 🎨** → photo3.jpg (casual selfie)
- **Chapter 4: My Favorite Moments With You 😊** → photo4.jpg (mirror selfie)
- **Chapter 5: Looking Forward, Always 💖** → photo5.jpg (formal/elegant)

## Alternative: Use Different Names

If you want to use different filenames, just update the `src` attribute in `index.html`:

For example, if your photo is named `my_photo.jpg`, change:
```html
<img src="photo1.jpg" alt="Our Memory">
```
to:
```html
<img src="my_photo.jpg" alt="Our Memory">
```

## Need Help?

The photos should be in JPG, PNG, or any common image format. The website will automatically resize them to look beautiful!
